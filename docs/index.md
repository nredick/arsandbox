*[ARSandbox]: Augmented Reality Sandbox

The Augmented Reality Sandbox is an augmented reality application that scans a sand surface using a Kinect 3D camera and projects a topography map that is updated in real time with topographic contour lines, hillshading, and an optional real-time water flow simulation back onto the sand surface using a calibrated projector.

The ARSandbox package contains the sandbox application itself, `SARndbox`, and a calibration utility to interactively measure a transformation between the Kinect camera scanning the sandbox surface, and the projector projecting onto it.
