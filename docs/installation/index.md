# Getting started

First and foremost, the appropriate hardware setup (physical sandbox, Kinect camera, and projector) and calibration is required before the `arsandbox` can be downloaded and installed.

The following documentation precisely outlines how (and why) to setup, calibrate, download, and install the requisite hardware and software. Several of the steps also include tutorial videos.

Good luck! :)
