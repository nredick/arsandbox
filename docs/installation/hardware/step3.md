<!-- ## Step 3: Mount the Kinect camera above the sandbox -->

In theory, the Kinect camera can be aimed at the sand surface from any position and/or angle.

For best results, we recommend to:

- position the camera such that it looks straight down onto the surface,
- position the camera such that the depth camera's field-of-view exactly matches the extents of the sandbox.

`RawKinectViewer` can be used to get real-time visual feedback while aligning the Kinect camera.
